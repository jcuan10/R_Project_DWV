The Data
=====================================  
Inputs {.sidebar}
-------------------------------------

```{r}
# shiny inputs define here

```

Context:

This analysis contains almost 6 years of daily time series data for several measures of traffic on a statistical forecasting note, provided by Kaggle.com.

The variables under study have complex seasonality that is keyed to the day of the week and to the academic calendar. 

The patterns you see here are similar in principle to what you would see in other daily data with day-of-week and time-of-year effects. 

The variables are daily counts of: “Page loads”, “Unique visitors”, “First-time visitors and “Returning visitors”.

There are 2167 rows of data spanning the date range from September 14, 2014, to August 19, 2020. 

Distributions seem to look normal, but they fail the normality test (Shapiro-Wilk Test).

Row {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Introduction

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("p4.jpg")
```   
 
### Data frame head/tail/summary
    
```{r}
head(DWV2_XTS)


tail(DWV2_XTS)


summary(DWV[,2:5])

```

### Histogram of the feature variables

```{r}
data_long <- DWV[,2:5] %>%  pivot_longer(colnames(DWV[,2:5])) %>% as.data.frame()
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = value)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram(color="black", fill="lightblue") + labs(title = "Histogram", x = "Values", y = "Density") + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free")
```


Daily Stat
=====================================  
Inputs {.sidebar}

```{r}

```

A visit is defined as a stream of hits on one or more pages on the site on a given day by the same user, as identified by IP address.

Multiple individuals with a shared IP address (e.g., in a computer lab) are considered as single users, so real users may be undercounted to some extent. 

A visit is classified as "unique" if a hit from the same IP address has not come within the last 6 hours. 

Returning visitors are identified by cookies if those are accepted. 

All others are classified as first-time visitors, so the count of unique visitors is the sum of the counts of returning and first-time visitors by definition. 


Row 
-------------------------------------
  
### Average/Day - Page Loads and Visitors (feature variables)
  
```{r}

The Series
=====================================  
Inputs {.sidebar}
-------------------------------------

```{r}
# shiny inputs define here

```

The following graphs show the trend of “Page loads” and “Visitors” over a time series. 

All series seem to have a constant fluctuation (trend over time) and are correlated to each other

Row {.tabset .tabset-fade}
-------------------------------------
  
### Page Loads and Visitors Time Serie - Overview
  
```{r}
plot(as.zoo(DWV2_XTS), screens = 1, lty = 1:4,  main = "Page Loads & Visitors over time ", xlab = "Date", ylab = "value", col = rainbow(4)) 
legend("topright", c("Page.Loads", "Unique.Visits", "First.Time.Visits", "Returning.Visits"), lty = 1:5, cex = 0.4, col = rainbow(4))

```   

### Page Loads and Visitors Time Serie -

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(4, 1), mex = 1, cex = 0.2)
plot(DWV2_XTS$A_Page.Loads, main = "Page Loads", col = "#FF0000")
plot(DWV2_XTS$B_Unique.Visits, main = "Unique Visits", col = "#80FF00")
plot(DWV2_XTS$C_First.Time.Visits, main = "First Time Visits", col = "#00FFFF")
plot(DWV2_XTS$D_Returning.Visits, main = "Returning Visits", col = "#8000FF")
```

### Correlation between feature variables

```{r}

Trends
=====================================  
Inputs {.sidebar}
-------------------------------------

```{r}

```

It is essential to analyze the trends prior to building any kind of time series model. 

The details we are interested in pertains to any kind of trend, seasonality, or random behavior in the series. 

Row {.tabset .tabset-fade}
-------------------------------------
  
### Monthly Trend
  
```{r}
# Monthly Trend (Seasonal)
par(mfrow = c(4, 1), mex = 1, cex = 0.4)
month_tr = apply.monthly(DWV2_XTS, mean)
barplot(month_tr$A_Page.Loads, main = "Page Loads / month", ylab = "Average" , col = "#FF0000")
barplot(month_tr$B_Unique.Visits, main = "Unique Visits / month", ylab = "Average" , col = "#80FF00")
barplot(month_tr$C_First.Time.Visits, main = "First Time Visits / month", ylab = "Average" , col = "#00FFFF")
barplot(month_tr$D_Returning.Visits, main = "Returning Visits / month", ylab = "Average" , col = "#8000FF")
```   

### Quartely Trend

```{r}
# Quartely Trend (Trend)
par(mfrow = c(4, 1), mex = 1, cex = 0.4)
quar_tr = apply.quarterly(DWV2_XTS, mean)
barplot(quar_tr$A_Page.Loads, main = "Page Loads / quarter", ylab = "Average" , col = "#FF0000")
barplot(quar_tr$B_Unique.Visits, main = "Unique Visits / quarter", ylab = "Average" , col = "#80FF00")
barplot(quar_tr$C_First.Time.Visits, main = "First Time Visits / quarter", ylab = "Average" , col = "#00FFFF")
barplot(quar_tr$D_Returning.Visits, main = "Returning Visits / quarter", ylab = "Average" , col = "#8000FF")
```

### Yearly Trend

```{r}
# Yearly Trend (Trend)
par(mfrow = c(4, 1), mex = 1, cex = 0.4)
year_tr = apply.yearly(DWV2_XTS, mean)
barplot(year_tr$A_Page.Loads, main = "Page Loads / year", ylab = "Average" , col = "#FF0000")
barplot(year_tr$B_Unique.Visits, main = "Unique Visits / year", ylab = "Average" , col = "#80FF00")

Analysis 
=====================================  
Inputs {.sidebar}

```{r}
# shiny inputs define here

```

ARIMA models are commonly used in time series modeling. 

In the ARIMA model, AR stands for auto-regression, I stands for integrated and MA stands for moving average. 

Row {.tabset .tabset-fade}
-------------------------------------
  
### Moving Average
  
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mex = 1, cex = 0.4)
PL_MA <- rollmean(DWV2_XTS$A_Page.Loads, 7, align = "right")
PL_MA <- merge(PL_MA, DWV2_XTS$A_Page.Loads)
plot(PL_MA, main = "Moving Average - Page Loads")

UV_MA <- rollmean(DWV2_XTS$B_Unique.Visits, 7, align = "right")
UV_MA <- merge(UV_MA, DWV2_XTS$B_Unique.Visits)
plot(UV_MA, main = "Moving Average - Unique Visits")
```   

### Autocorrelation

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mex = 1, cex = 0.4)
acf(DWV2_XTS$A_Page.Loads, main = "Autocorrelation - Page Loads")
acf(DWV2_XTS$B_Unique.Visits, main = "Autocorrelation - Unique Visits")
```

### Partial Autocorrelation

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mex = 1, cex = 0.4)
pacf(DWV2_XTS$A_Page.Loads, main = "Partial Autocorrelation - Page Loads")
pacf(DWV2_XTS$B_Unique.Visits, main = "Partial Autocorrelation - Unique Visits")
```


Forecast

Once we have the final ARIMA model, we are now ready to make predictions on the future time points. 

We can also visualize the trends if the model works fine.

### Page Loads - ARIMA Model
  
```{r}
AAm_PL <- auto.arima(DWV2_XTS$A_Page.Loads)
checkresiduals(AAm_PL)

```   

### Unique Visitors - ARIMA Model
  
```{r}
AAm_UV <- auto.arima(DWV2_XTS$B_Unique.Visits)
checkresiduals(AAm_UV)
```   

### Page Loads - Forecast

```{r}
fc_PL <- forecast(AAm_PL, h=100)
autoplot(fc_PL)
```

### Unique Visitors - Forecast

```{r}
fc_UV <- forecast(AAm_UV, h=100)
autoplot(fc_UV)
